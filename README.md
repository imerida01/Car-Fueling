# Car-Fueling

## Problem Description 

Input Format.: The first line contains an integer 𝑑. The second line contains an integer 𝑚. The third line specifies an integer 𝑛. Finally, the last line contains integers stop1 ,stop2 , . . . ,stop𝑛. 

Output Format.: Assuming that the distance between the cities is 𝑑 miles, a car can travel at most 𝑚 miles on a full tank, and there are gas stations at distances stop1 ,stop2 , . . . ,stop𝑛 along the way, output the minimum number of refills needed. Assume that the car starts with a full tank. If it is not possible to reach the destination, output −1. 

Constraints.: 1 ≤ 𝑑 ≤ 105 . 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 400. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 300. 0 &lt; stop1 &lt; stop2 &lt; · · · &lt; stop𝑛 &lt; 𝑑.
